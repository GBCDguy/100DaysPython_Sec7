Day 7:
Today's Progress:
Today, I built a basic Hangman game in Python. The game allows the user to guess letters of a hidden word, and I implemented logic to track correct and incorrect guesses. I also created a simple word bank and used an ASCII hangman to visualize the player's remaining lives.

What I Learned:

Random Module: Used random.choice() to select a word from the word bank.
Control Flow: Utilized while loops and if-else statements to control the game's progression and handle user input.
String Manipulation: Managed the display of the hidden word by replacing underscores (_) with correctly guessed letters.
Game Logic: Created conditions to determine if the player won (guessed all letters correctly) or lost (ran out of lives), and printed the appropriate message.
ASCII Art: Displayed a hangman figure that updates as the player makes incorrect guesses, making the game more interactive.
Challenges:
One of the challenges was ensuring that the game could handle repeated guesses without penalizing the player twice. Also, managing the game loop and exit conditions took some trial and error.

Thoughts:
This was a fun project that really helped me practice implementing game logic and control flow in Python. The Hangman project is a great way to apply many foundational Python concepts. I look forward to refining the code, adding new features, and potentially expanding the word bank.
